    "As we learned yesterday, machines cannot interpret raw text. We need to transform that text into something we/machines can more readily analyze. Yesterday, we did simple counts of counts to summarize the content of Amazon reviews. Today, we'll extend those concepts to talk about vector representations such as Bag of Words (BoW) and word embedding models. We'll use those representations for search, visualization, and prepare for our classification day tomorrow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Processing text data to prepare it for machine learning models often means translating the information from documents into a numerical format. Bag-of-Words approaches (sometimes referred to as Frequency-Based word embeddings) accomplish this by \"vectorizing\" tokenized documents. This is done by representing each document as a row in a DataFrame and creating a column for each unique word in the corpora (group of documents). The presence or lack of a given word in a document is then represented either as a raw count of how many times a given word appears in a document (CountVectorizer) or as that word's TF-IDF score (TfidfVectorizer).\n",

       "b'Ink helps drive democracy in Asia\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kyrgyz Republic, a small, mountainous state of the former Soviet republic, is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the country\\'s elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis new technology is causing both worries and guarded optimism among different sectors of the population. In an effort to live up to its reputation in the 1990s as \"an island of democracy\", the Kyrgyz President, Askar Akaev, pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming Parliamentary and Presidential elections. The US government agreed to fund all expenses associated with this decision.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kyrgyz Republic is seen by many experts as backsliding from the high point it reached in the mid-1990s with a hastily pushed through referendum in 2003, reducing the legislative branch to one chamber with 75 deputies. The use of ink is only one part of a general effort to show commitment towards more open elections - the German Embassy, the Soros Foundation and the Kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe actual technology behind the ink is not that complicated. The ink is sprayed on a person\\'s left thumb. It dries and is not visible under normal light.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the presence of ultraviolet light (of the kind used to verify money) causes the ink to glow with a neon yellow light. At the entrance to each polling station, one election official will scan voter\\'s fingers with UV lamp before allowing them to enter, and every voter will have his/her left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot. If the ink shows under the UV light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station. Likewise, any voter who refuses to be inked will not receive the ballot. These elections are assuming even greater significance because of two large factors - the upcoming parliamentary elections are a prelude to a potentially regime changing presidential election in the Autumn as well as the echo of recent elections in other former Soviet Republics, notably Ukraine and Georgia. The use of ink has been controversial - especially among groups perceived to be pro-government.\\r\\n\\r\\nWidely circulated articles compared the use of ink to the rural practice of marking sheep - a still common metaphor in this primarily agricultural society.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe author of one such article began a petition drive against the use of the ink. The greatest part of the opposition to ink has often been sheer ignorance. Local newspapers have carried stories that the ink is harmful, radioactive or even that the ultraviolet readers may cause health problems. Others, such as the aggressively middle of the road, Coalition of Non-governmental Organizations, have lauded the move as an important step forward. This type of ink has been used in many elections in the world, in countries as varied as Serbia, South Africa, Indonesia and Turkey. The other common type of ink in elections is indelible visible ink - but as the elections in Afghanistan showed, improper use of this type of ink can cause additional problems. The use of \"invisible\" ink is not without its own problems. In most elections, numerous rumors have spread about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Serbia, for example, both Christian and Islamic leaders assured their populations that its use was not contrary to religion. Other rumours are associated with how to remove the ink - various soft drinks, solvents and cleaning products are put forward. However, in reality, the ink is very effective at getting under the cuticle of the thumb and difficult to wash off. The ink stays on the finger for at least 72 hours and for up to a week. The use of ink and readers by itself is not a panacea for election ills. The passage of the inking law is, nevertheless, a clear step forward towards free and fair elections.\" The country\\'s widely watched parliamentary elections are scheduled for 27 February.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Mikosz works for the IFES, an international, non-profit organisation that supports the building of democratic societies.\\r\\n'"

    "### NearestNeighbor (K-NN) \n",
    "\n",
    "To address the computational inefficiencies of the brute-force approach, a variety of tree-based data structures have been invented. In general, these structures attempt to reduce the required number of distance calculations by efficiently encoding aggregate distance information for the sample. The basic idea is that if point  is very distant from point , and point  is very close to point , then we know that points  and  are very distant, without having to explicitly calculate their distance. In this way, the computational cost of a nearest neighbors search can be reduced to  or better. This is a significant improvement over brute-force for large data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the inefficiencies of KD Trees in higher dimensions, the ball tree data structure was developed. Where KD trees partition data along Cartesian axes, ball trees partition data in a series of nesting hyper-spheres. This makes tree construction more costly than that of the KD tree, but results in a data structure which can be very efficient on highly structured data, even in very high dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A ball tree recursively divides the data into nodes defined by a centroid  and radius , such that each point in the node lies within the hyper-sphere defined by  and . The number of candidate points for a neighbor search is reduced through use of the triangle inequality:\n",
    "\n",
    "With this setup, a single distance calculation between a test point and the centroid is sufficient to determine a lower and upper bound on the distance to all points within the node. Because of the spherical geometry of the ball tree nodes, it can out-perform a KD-tree in high dimensions, though the actual performance is highly dependent on the structure of the training data. In scikit-learn, ball-tree-based neighbors searches are specified using the keyword algorithm = 'ball_tree', and are computed using the class sklearn.neighbors.BallTree. Alternatively, the user can work with the BallTree class directly."

    "## Overview\n",
    "### BoW discards textual context\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the limitations of Bag-of-Words approaches is that any information about the textual context surrounding that word is lost. This also means that with bag-of-words approaches often the only tools that we have for identifying words with similar usage or meaning and subsequently consolidating them into a single vector is through the processes of stemming and lemmatization which tend to be quite limited at consolidating words unless the two words are very close in their spelling or in their root parts-of-speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embedding approaches preserve more textual context\n",
    "Word2Vec is an increasingly popular word embedding technique. Like Bag-of-words it learns a real-value vector representation for a predefined fixed-size vocabulary that is generated from a corpus of text. However, in contrast to BoW, Word2Vec approaches are much more capable of accounting for textual context, and are better at discovering words with similar meanings or usages (semantic or syntactic similarity).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Word2Vec Intuition\n",
    "### The Distribution Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand how Word2Vec preserves textual context we have to understand what's called the Distribution Hypothesis (Reference: Distribution Hypothesis Theory  -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics. The Distribution Hypothesis operates under the assumption that words that have similar contexts will have similar meanings. Practically speaking, this means that if two words are found to have similar words both to the right and to the left of them throughout the corpora then those words have the same context and are assumed to have the same meaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "> \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps\" - John Firth\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we let the usage of a word define its meaning and its \"similarity\" to other words. In the following example, which words would you say have a similar meaning? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentence 1**: Traffic was light today\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentence 2**: Traffic was heavy yesterday\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentence 3**: Prediction is that traffic will be smooth-flowing tomorrow since it is a national holiday\n",
    "\n",
    "What words in the above sentences seem to have a similar meaning if all you knew about them was the context in which they appeared above? \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take a look at how this might work in action, the following example is simplified, but will give you an idea of the intuition for how this works.\n",

Word2Vec can consider a larger context than only words that are immediately to the left and right of a given word, but we're going to keep our window of context small for this example.

    "### Word2Vec Variants\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Skip-Gram\n",
    "\n",
    "The Skip-Gram method predicts the neighbors’ of a word given a center word. In the skip-gram model, we take a center word and a window of context (neighbors) words to train the model and then predict context words out to some window size for each center word.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notion of “context” or “neighboring” words is best described by considering a center word and a window of words around it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we consider the sentence **“The speedy Porsche drove past the elegant Rolls-Royce”** and a window size of 2, we’d have the following pairs for the skip-gram model:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text:**\n",
    "**The**\tspeedy\tPorsche\tdrove\tpast\tthe\telegant\tRolls-Royce\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The **Skip-gram model** is going to output a probability distribution i.e. the probability of a word appearing in context given a center word and we are going to select the vector representation that maximizes the probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "With CountVectorizer and TF-IDF the best we could do for context was to look at common bi-grams and tri-grams (n-grams). Well, skip-grams go far beyond that and give our model much stronger contextual information.\n",

    "## Continuous Bag of Words\n",
    "\n",
    "This model takes thes opposite approach from the skip-gram model in that it tries to predict a center word based on the neighboring words. In the case of the CBOW model, we input the context words within the window (such as “the”, “Proshe”, “drove”) and aim to predict the target or center word “speedy” (the input to the prediction pipeline is reversed as compared to the SkipGram model).\n",

    "## Notable Differences between Word Embedding methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) W2V focuses less document topic-modeling. You'll notice that the vectorizations don't really retain much information about the original document that the information came from. At least not in our examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) W2V can result in really large and complex vectorizations. In fact, you need Deep Neural Networks to train your Word2Vec models from scratch, but we can use helpful pretrained embeddings (thank you Google) to do really cool things!\n",
